## Database & Table Structure  
### **Database Creation**  
```sql
CREATE DATABASE retail_store;
```
### **Table Definition**  
```sql
CREATE TABLE retail (
    transactions_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    sale_date DATE,
    sale_time TIME,
    customer_id INT,
    gender VARCHAR(10),
    age INT,
    category VARCHAR(50),
    quantiy INT,
    price_per_unit FLOAT,
    cogs FLOAT,
    total_sale FLOAT
);
```

## Data Cleaning üõ†  
To ensure **data integrity**, null values are identified and removed:  
```sql
SELECT * FROM retail WHERE transactions_id IS NULL 
    OR sale_date IS NULL OR sale_time IS NULL 
    OR customer_id IS NULL OR gender IS NULL 
    OR age IS NULL OR category IS NULL 
    OR quantiy IS NULL OR price_per_unit IS NULL 
    OR cogs IS NULL OR total_sale IS NULL;
```
```sql
DELETE FROM retail WHERE transactions_id IS NULL 
    OR sale_date IS NULL OR sale_time IS NULL 
    OR customer_id IS NULL OR gender IS NULL 
    OR age IS NULL OR category IS NULL 
    OR quantiy IS NULL OR price_per_unit IS NULL 
    OR cogs IS NULL OR total_sale IS NULL;
```
